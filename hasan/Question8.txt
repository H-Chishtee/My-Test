"==" (Double Equal Operator)
The double equal operator performs type coercion, meaning it converts the operands to the same type before making the comparison.
If the operands are of different types, JavaScript will try to convert one or both of them to a common type.
console.log(1 == '1'); // true (coercion: '1' is converted to 1)


"===" (Triple Equal Operator):
The triple equal operator does not perform type coercion. It checks for both value and type equality.
If the operands are of different types, the comparison will always return false.
console.log(1 === '1'); // false (strict equality, types are different)
